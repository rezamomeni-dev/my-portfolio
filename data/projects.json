    "description": "Democratizing fine art ownership through a secure, transparent digital marketplace.",
    "about": "Artunity was born from the need to make high-end art accessible to a broader audience while ensuring artists receive fair compensation. Traditional galleries often impose high fees and geographical limitations. Artunity solves this by providing a decentralized platform where artists can list their work directly to collectors worldwide.\n\nThe platform features real-time bidding for auctions, secure escrow payments, and a high-fidelity image viewer that allows collectors to inspect brushwork and texture before purchasing. The minimalist design philosophy ensures that the UI never distracts from the artwork itself.",
